        <h1>Possible images for my website!</h1>
        <h2>Image 1</h2>
        <p>The first image I would like to include is a picture of my headshot. I think it is important to include a personal image to help visitors understand who I am a bit better! In April or May, I will be getting graduation pictures done so I might update this photo with a different one but for now I will be using this one.</p>

        <h2>Image 2</h2>
        <p>The next image I would like to include is an image of the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy. The time I spent studying abroad was a very formative experience for me and I want to include a section about it! I felt that this picture was perfect because I used to walk along the Ponte Vecchio almost every day for my classes making it very meaningful and relevant to my experience abroad.

        <h2>Image 3</h2>
        <p>The last image I am thinking about including is an image of the UMass Amherst school logo. Attending this school has helped me meet so many new people and learn so many new things. I want to include the logo somewhere on my website as this school is central to my academic and personal abilities. </p>
