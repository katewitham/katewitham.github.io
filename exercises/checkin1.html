    <h1>How to make Spaghetti Carbonara! </h1>
    <p>Growing up in an Italian household, pasta was a staple of my family's meals. My favorite dish to have was my grandmother's Spaghetti Carbonara. During my time in Italy, I learned how to make it myself and it became one of my most made dishes!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Guanciale</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a large pot of salted water.</li>
        <li>While the water is boiling, cut the guanciale in thick peices and cook it in a large pan until crispy.</li>
        <li>Finely grate your Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. The pasta will be stirred into the sauce once done. </li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti and cook until al dente.</li>
        <li>Reserve some pasta water before draining the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti and guanciale are cooked, toss the pasta in with the guanciale so that the gets fully coated in the guancile fat for the fullest taste. </li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat and quickly stir in the egg and cheese mixture, using the reserved pasta water to thin out the sauce if necessary. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper on top!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When cooking the guanciale, you don't need to add any oil or butter since the guanciale will release its own fat.</li>
        <li>Be sure to remove the pan from heat before adding the egg mixture to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta in a warm bowl, as pasta is always best served fresh and hot!</li>
